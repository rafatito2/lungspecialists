00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:12,980 [Rafael]
[phone chimes]
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,000 [Rafael]
Hello?
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,240 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
How are you?
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,200 [Rafael]
Hi, Shai. How are you? Thanks for having me.
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,960 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I'm well, and yourself?
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,090 [Rafael]
All good. All good. Um, well, first of all, thank you for having the time to meet me, and00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,090 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Of course
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:34,920 [Rafael]
... I really appreciate it. So, uh, uh, the page is for the doctor, right? For Dr. Fishman, I'm right?
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:58,180 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah. So we have two providers. Um, the owner is Dr. Gabriel Romero Fishman, and his partner
is Eric Palma, and they-- Dr. Fishman bought the practice from Dr. Azar about a year and a half
ago, and we just don't have a website. We never had a website, and we think if we have a
website, it'll generate more people to come in and see our office or just become patients, you
know?
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,720 [Rafael]
Of course.
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:11,860 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
He wants a way for them to be able to possibly, like, schedule an appointment or request an
appointment through the website, um, a space where patients can leave reviews on the
website, things like that.
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:19,050 [Rafael]
Perfect. Perfect. So, okay, my goal basically today is to... I'm gonna ask you, like, a couple of
questions. I wanna know exactly00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,050 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:26,420 [Rafael]
... what you're looking for, and I want you guys to decide if I'm the right person that you're
looking for to, to do this website.
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,480 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay. 
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:45,850 [Rafael]
So first of all, I don't do ge- like, generic templates. I really work, like, tailored to what the
doctor wants, to what the client wants, um, I do all the changes people need. If you want
something, I, I'll, I'll change it, and I will do whatever gu- you, you want to, you know, to work
on.
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:45,860 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,560 [Rafael]
So basically, the questions I want to do, and if it's fine, I'm gonna record it, so I have it, like,
kind of, uh, organized it.
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,680 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,120 [Rafael]
Um, so basically, one of the questions is, what's the main purpose for the website? Um, so if
you can tell me.
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,630 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
To generate more business00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,650 [Rafael]
Okay
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,940 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... coming into our practice.
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:20,640 [Rafael]
Also, okay, yeah, to bringing new patients to the, to the business. Perfect. And, uh, yeah, that
basically answered that. Also, if you want the, the site to feel more like medical professional or
warmer, like more personal, um00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,240 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Can it be like a little bit of both?
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,120 [Rafael]
Yeah, it can be a little bit of both.
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,880 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah, I think a little bit of both would be great.
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,400 [Rafael]
Awesome. I guess you want the contact forms, uh, appointment request, insurance info,
location details00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,410 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,800 [Rafael]
... all this stuff? 
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,250 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes.
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,940 [Rafael]
Okay, perfect.
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,329 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Maybe a little background on the doctors, you know, so they know.
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:52,100 [Rafael]
Background on the doctors, of course. Okay, [mumbling] let me put this, check it. Check.
[background chattering] Okay. Y- y- did you ever have a, a website before? Like, do you have a
domain or not?
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:06,620 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
No. I do know, like, that we're on Google. So, uh, the previous owner, Dr. Azar, was able to do,
like, a Google thing. So if someone looked up pulmonary doctors, we will populate. Um, but he
never had, like, an actual website.
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,780 [Rafael]
Okay.
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,840 [Rafael]
Wait, so what's the name of, like, the practice?
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,480 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Lung Disease Specialists Corporation.
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,040 [Rafael]
Okay.
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,360 [Rafael]
Perfect. And what kind of a, of doctor is he? Like, what's the name of a... It's like a lung
specialist?
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,720 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah, we're a pulmonary office.
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,100 [Rafael]
A pulmonary office, okay.
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:42,180 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
So we specialize in, um, the lungs, sleep medicine. We do sleep studies here. Um, we have, like,
pulmonary function test here.
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:58,000 [Rafael]
Okay, perfect. [mouse clicking] Okay, perfect. Also, do, do you have any, any documents,
anything you can tell me, like, send me, if you, if you can send me, like, as much information
you can of the practice?
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,100 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah, like, if you want our paperwork- 
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,600 [Rafael]
Yeah
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,800 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... um, our notice of privacy, we have that. Um, maybe, like, a list of insurances or00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,049 [Rafael]
Right. Yeah, yeah
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:15,079 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... like, a general list of insurances that we accept on the website. I think that would be great.
What else can you think about, Analise?
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:21,000 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Definitely, like, a spot, um, because it's just two of us here, so if we're both on the phone, we
miss some calls.
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,140 [Rafael]
Yeah.
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,680 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
So if there's, like, maybe, like, a message box or00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:23,890 [Rafael]
Yeah, yeah
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,440 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... you know00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,660 [Rafael]
Of course
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:34,860 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... a request for an appointment, something like that would be great, that we can go in and look
at it. 'Cause we wanna be able to go in and pull, like, who requested an appointment00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:34,900 [Rafael]
Yes
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,600 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... or who had a question where they couldn't get us on the phone.
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,610 [Rafael]
Uh00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,140 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Something like that, maybe.
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,860 [Rafael]
Have you ever used Calendly by any chance?
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,580 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
What is it called? 
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,140 [Rafael]
Calendly.
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,340 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
No. Calendly?
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,400 [Rafael]
No.
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,720 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I've never heard of it.
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,380 [Rafael]
For example, like, for schedules and everything, how do you do it?
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,860 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
They have to call, and we have our system with CureMD, that's our EHR system.
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,260 [Rafael]
Okay.
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,380 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Our EMR system, and they just call, and we make them appointments over the phone.
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,440 [Rafael]
Okay. So like, w- what I did, I, I... Like, Jack told me he talked with you. They, they have, like,
this00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,450 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Mm-hmm
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:28,340 [Rafael]
... uh, Osmed company, so I linked it to their Calendly. Calendly is very useful 'cause you can
open an account, and in, in, in the app, you don't need any coding skills, nothing. You just put
the days you- you're available, and people can, you know, like, through the website, they can,
they can do it. And you can link this to, I don't know, to your Microsoft calendar, Google
calendars, like00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,420 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:38,880 [Rafael]
... it's a, it's a very, very, very useful tool. I really recommend it, but if not, I can also, whatever
tool you guys use, I can adapt it. Like, I'm very adaptable.
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
The thing is, I don't trust all my patients.
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,580 [Rafael]
Yeah.
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:52,550 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Um, you know, like, they'll book appointments knowing an authorization is needed. They won't
tell us authorization is needed. They won't tell their primary that they need an authorization. So
they come in, we see the patient, and then boom!
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560 [Rafael]
Yeah.
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:13,352 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
We're hit with a denial because we weren't aware that an authorization is needed. I think, um,
the patients that have, like, Medicare, straight Medicaid, or a PPO plan, they can be able to
book their appointment.... but any HMO plans or plans that need authorizations, they, they can
request it, and then we'll be given it, we'll give it to them.
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:13,892 [Rafael]
Okay.
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:19,032 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
So, um, I just don't fully trust them having access to our schedule, 'cause00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:19,421 [Rafael]
Yeah, I get it.
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,352 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
-I'll come in, and it'll probably be, like, eighteen people at nine o'clock.
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:30,861 [Rafael]
Yes. So yeah, the, the point of Calendly is that it doesn't let you, like, the same pe- like, to
make, uh, appointments to two persons at the same time and all that.
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:30,952 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Oh, yeah.
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:33,842 [Rafael]
Like, you can adjust it the, the way you want.
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:33,852 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
No, we do get00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:41,752 [Rafael]
And if you want, we also can, can put, like, some kind of a questionnaire, like asking the, all this
information to the client before letting them schedule the appointment.
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:42,392 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I agree.
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:42,822 [Rafael]
You know, so00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:43,712 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I think that's a great idea.
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:46,432 [Rafael]
That's doable, like, a hundred percent. 
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:46,932 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,932 [Rafael]
And
00:06:48,932 --> 00:07:01,861 [Rafael]
okay, that, that's perfect. Like, uh, w-whenever you can, send me as much information you
have of you guys. You know, I'll just concentrate the information, understand what's, uh,
relevant, what's not. And of course, you, you're the one that decide that.
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:01,872 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah.
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:21,252 [Rafael]
Like, if you tell me it's very relevant, I want you to put it. If there, there's some things also
that... If you have things that you're always like, [lips smack] that you feel like clients always
misunderstand, and you're, you feel like you're repeating yourself a lot of times telling clients,
and you feel that it needs to be highlighted in the website, we will do it, we will put it, we will
make it, you know. So00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,212 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay, that works.
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:22,412 [Rafael]
No, thank you.
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:25,732 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Will you e- will you text me your email address, and I can email you all the stuff?
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,952 [Rafael]
Yes, I'll send you everything. Wait, let me00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:28,932 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:39,292 [Rafael]
Let me put that so... [mumbling] Okay. Perfect. That's the website. So let, let me tell you a little
bit how I work00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:39,542 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Mm-hmm.
00:07:39,542 --> 00:08:03,172 [Rafael]
... so you guys know. So after this meeting, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take, uh, a week, and
I'm gonna show you guys a preview of how the website can look. And you can look at it, tell me
what you like, what you don't like, what you want changed it. And at this point, if, if you feel like
it's not the right direction, it's not what you were looking for, there's no obligation. Okay?
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:03,832 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:11,072 [Rafael]
So that's very important for me. I don't want there-- You, you know, there's people that make
website, sometimes they take a long time, and00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:11,252 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:18,832 [Rafael]
... then, uh, you pay all this money, and you feel they give you something you don't like, and
that's not what I'm interested. You know, I'm also00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:18,842 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I agree
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:22,962 [Rafael]
... very interested in building my, my popularity here 'cause, uh00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:22,962 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Mm-hmm
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:28,821 [Rafael]
... I came from another country, um, you know, like I used to do this also outside of the States,
and I'm00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:28,821 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:32,251 [Rafael]
... trying to build, like, a client base, so that's also important for me.
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:32,332 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah.
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:39,592 [Rafael]
I'll talk to you about my pricing a little bit. I, I consider it a very, very good price, you know, like,
compared with what people are charging here.
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:40,192 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Mm-hmm.
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:47,852 [Rafael]
Uh, but yeah, first of all, that's the first thing. I'll take a week. I'll show you guys what I have.
You'll let me know if you, you decide to continue or00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:48,432 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:57,912 [Rafael]
... or whatever. And at this point, if you do want to continue, uh, I will ask for a fifty percent, uh,
for the start00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:57,922 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay 
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:18,802 [Rafael]
... and the other fifty percent when the site is finished. And once we move forward, uh, I'll take
about three weeks to refine everything. This means also mobile optimization, like, uh, tablet
optimization. You want your page to, to also be, to look good on when people use- see it from
their, their mobile phones or from their desktop computers, tablets, whatever.
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:20,271 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
[chuckles] That's a great idea.
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:23,372 [Rafael]
Yes, that's very important. Sometimes people forget this, you know, like, uh00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:23,672 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:27,482 [Rafael]
... you end up with a cool website, but then you look at it from the phone, and everything is00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:28,771 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
[chuckles] And you don't see anything.
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:35,881 [Rafael]
Yeah, you don't see anything, or everything is the wrong sizes and everything. It happens a lot,
you know. There's a lot of pa- lazy people in this business that00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,172 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
That is a great idea
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:37,722 [Rafael]
... that don't take it.
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:40,952 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I thought it was always the phone. I didn't know you actually had to make your website00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:41,312 [Rafael]
Yes
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:41,712 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... fit.
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:49,862 [Rafael]
You gotta optimize it. You start by doing the, the desktop version, and then you start optimizing
everything. You know, sometimes it needs to make things smaller, things swipable, you know,
all this kind of stuff.
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,332 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Oh, that is so cool.
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:51,352 [Rafael]
So00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:51,742 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay, yeah, I like that 
00:09:51,742 --> 00:10:10,452 [Rafael]
... that's important. So yeah, I will polish all that, the visual de- details, layout, uh, also maybe
images you want, background. Uh, I don't know if you have, um, [lips smack] uh, some
compliances or whatever that you want also to put in the, in the website, um, certifications,
whatever.
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:11,031 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:11,521 [Rafael]
And00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,992 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay, cool.
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:34,342 [Rafael]
So, uh, yeah, once, uh, we also agree in the preview, we will agree on a delivery date together.
I'll take at least three, four weeks, no more. I feel today we're on the twenty-seventh of January.
I want you guys to have a website ready for the end of February. Okay? I feel like there are also
people that, I don't know, take a year, a complete year doing a website00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:34,362 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:44,052 [Rafael]
... and you're just waiting. Uh, so, no, me, I will compromise to a date with you, and I'll do it to
that date. I'm not gonna take a day after that00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:44,062 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:49,431 [Rafael]
... a day before. I'm gonna give it to you the date I'm telling you. That's very important for me.
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,052 [Rafael]
Um00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:53,642 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah, Jack showed me the website. I was like: I need his information.
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:54,232 [Rafael]
Yeah. [chuckles]
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:54,972 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Send it.
00:10:54,972 --> 00:11:03,492 [Rafael]
Yeah, yeah, I really, I have a lot of passion to- for what I do. I... For me, that's very important,
you know, for the people to be happy with what I'm doing.
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:04,172 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah. 
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:36,291 [Rafael]
And well, that, that's, uh, basically it. Uh, yeah, so at this, this date, we're gonna finish, and also
after the, the, let's say we finish the website on the twenty-seventh of February, I'll still give
you guys a year, a whole year, where you can make changes. Let's say two- after two months,
you decide, I don't know, you're offering a different service, or you have a different certification,
or whatever you guys want that you need to add to the page, I give you a whole year where
you can text me and say: "Hi, Rafael, I need to, to change whatever you want from the web
page."
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,300 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Oh, that's great.
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,300 [Rafael]
You know?
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,300 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,991 [Rafael]
So I feel like also there's things that come up later, you know, and like maybe00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,002 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Very true
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:49,092 [Rafael]
... maybe after a month, you, you decide something, you, you want something different, or you
didn't like anything, and, you know, I'm very open with that.
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:49,492 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Correct.
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:58,500 [Rafael]
Uh, another thing that I take care of is SEO. I don't know if you know, uh, what that means. It's
basically that your website appears in Google.... Oh, you want00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,809 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes, Jack mentioned that to me. That would be really great.
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:06,800 [Rafael]
Yeah, that's very important. I want when somebody writes the name of the doctor, I want their
we- the website to appear there, and00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,080 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Right.
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,820 [Rafael]
Um, uh, and, you know, that's basically also if you00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:10,830 [Speaker 2]
...
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:17,520 [Rafael]
-you write pulmonary care, I don't know where, where, where you guys are based. It's Fort
Lauderdale, I think, or?
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes, Fort Lauderdale.
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,739 [Rafael]
Okay, so if you, if somebody in Fort Lauderdale search for pulmonary something, I want you
guys to be, to be there.
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,340 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I agree.
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,740 [Rafael]
Okay, that's, uh00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,640 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I think that's very smart.
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:39,570 [Rafael]
That's important. Also, I'll tell you, that's kind of a process. You know, it's sometimes a little bit
competitive. Maybe you won't be the first person to appear, 'cause there are people that
sponsor their, their, their [laughing] Google Search, and they want to appear first.
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:39,580 [Speaker 2]
...
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:52,450 [Rafael]
That's something we can also talk about later, and if you want me to also do SEO, that's like a
different service that I will provide with time, and, you know, it's... Because it's competitive, it's
something that you have to, like, try. The, like the00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:52,450 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes
00:12:52,450 --> 00:13:03,680 [Rafael]
... trial and error to see, to see... But, but I would do, you know, like, the basic SEO, which
means that when you search the name of the, the doctor, you'll be in the Google, in the Google
search, and also when you00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,360 [Speaker 2]
...
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,720 [Rafael]
If you are somebody from the area and you search for the practice, you're gonna find it. You
know?
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,540 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Oh, nice. Okay.
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:17,320 [Rafael]
It's the most basic, and also from that, you can also, you know, like, work forward and make it
better and make it better and, you know. 
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,079 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Correct.
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,140 [Rafael]
So we talk about post-launch support, and00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,230 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Rafael, hang on one second.
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240 [Rafael]
Yes.
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,400 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Just hang on one moment.
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,200 [Rafael]
Yeah, of course, of course.
00:13:34,700 --> 00:14:45,740 [Rafael]
 Okay, I'm back. Sorry, I had to just answer the phone.
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:52,460 [Rafael]
All good, all good. Um, so where were we?
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,700 [Speaker 2]
About Google.
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:06,560 [Rafael]
Yeah, about the Google. So yeah, basically that, you're gonna be able to find the doctor on
Google. I think that's, like, one of the most important things, and that, it's also one of the things
that brings mo- most clients. It's like advertising, but, you know, appearing in Google00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,649 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes, correct
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:07,920 [Rafael]
... is very, very important, I think.
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,320 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
And they love to Google.
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:16,300 [Rafael]
Yes. Yeah, and somebody, if I hear me, even me, if I hear the name of a doctor, I search in
Google first. I put the name of the doctor, you know, and I feel like00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,450 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,119 [Rafael]
... that, that builds trust in somehow.
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,410 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:25,340 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yeah, and both of my doctors came from Miami, so, like, when people Google, they're like: "I'm
not driving to Miami." I'm like: "No, we're not in Miami."
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,420 [Rafael]
Yeah.
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,320 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
They just... That's where their old information stems from.
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,800 [Rafael]
So those things, we are gonna make it clear in the website, so, so people are not confused
anymore.
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,240 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Correct.
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,740 [Rafael]
So, okay.
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,380 [Speaker 2]
Two last things.
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,700 [Rafael]
Now, pricing, I charge, uh, uh, fifteen hundred.
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,640 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:54,960 [Rafael]
Uh, that includes everything. Uh, that includes the design, developet- development, SEO, that is
the Google thing I told you, the launch, launch, and the one year of ongoing updates.
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,380 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay.
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:07,240 [Rafael]
And, uh, well, that's basically it. Like, um, I will take everything that, that we talked and of
course, start on the preview, and that's my next goal.
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,380 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
The Google thing00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,390 [Rafael]
Yes
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,500 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... is it S, as in Sam, F-O?
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,080 [Rafael]
No, it's S-S-E-O, like S-E-O. Search engine00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,210 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Oh
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,560 [Rafael]
... optimization is the00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Got it, SEO.
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,200 [Rafael]
Yes.
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,160 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Okay. I'm just jotting down some notes.
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,390 [Rafael]
Yes.
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,299 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
The launch, open year. Okay, perfect.
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,300 [Rafael]
Also, if you want, if you have the time, I can show you also the website I did to Jack, uh, for his
company.
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,380 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Oh, I already looked at it00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,479 [Rafael]
Yeah
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,400 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
... but we did great.
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,620 [Rafael]
Okay, I, I have a lot of changes.
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:35,980 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
That's what- [laughing]
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:43,880 [Rafael]
At the, at the end, everybody gets their own website, you know, I, I, I don't want... I, I don't like
showing you that website 'cause you're gonna think your website is gonna look exactly like
that.
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,110 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
No, yeah, you totally00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:56,300 [Rafael]
It's gonna look, you know, tailored to your needs, tailored to what... If you see something you
like from that website, of course, tell me and tell me, "I like this. I want this on my website." I
put, uh, something they liked a lot is that I add, like, a section of reviews00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,400 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,200 [Rafael]
... from patients. I mean, that's look, uh, very good. It looks, uh, I think00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,789 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
It looked great. The website you did for him was great.
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:03,799 [Rafael]
Yeah.
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,540 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
That's why I was like: "Yeah, send me his number."
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:05,700 [Rafael]
No, I00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:12,160 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
He was literally standing right behind me, and we were looking at his website together. I'm like:
"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I need to speak to him."
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,400 [Rafael]
Yeah, I, I feel00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,500 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Because he found00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,000 [Rafael]
I really, I, I do it with love, with a lot of love, really.
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,700 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
He found one person to do the website, and they were gonna charge him, like, five thousand
dollars.
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,720 [Rafael]
Yeah.
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,360 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
And then they never got back to him, so I was like: "You know what? We're not gonna do it."
And then he came in yesterday, and I was like: "Look, I have somebody who could do our d- our
website for us," and he's like00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:41,540 [Rafael]
Yeah, I know, I know. There's people here in the US, that- that's what people charge, actually.
Five thousand dollars is, is not that, uh, that crazy, but then there's people that take a year.
They tell you: "Five thousand dollars, and that'll take me a year to do the website." It's like, uh00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,950 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
And the website crashes.
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,060 [Rafael]
My friend. [laughing] 
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,560 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
It doesn't look good. It's so confusing. And you know what kills me, is when I go on all these
websites and there's no fax number.
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,960 [Rafael]
Yes.
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,330 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Why is there no fax number? So now I gotta pick up the phone, I gotta call you and wait on
hold, when if your fax number was on the website, I could've done this in a minute.
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,220 [Rafael]
Yeah, yeah, you do it fast, and you send the fax, and that's it. Yeah.
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,000 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Correct.
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:22,228 [Rafael]
... so don't worry, all, all those things, we will figure it out, figure them out. We will have them in
your website. And like I, I told you, really, like, I'm, I'm gonna show you in a week, and you'll
decide. Really, no compromise, uh, don't feel bad. If you really don't like it, just, just tell me.
Tell me, "Rafael, I don't like it. I don't want to continue, or I want you to change this and this
and this."
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:22,368 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
I sure will.
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:32,528 [Rafael]
And I'll be open to, to whatever makes you happy, guys. I want you really to have a good
website, that looks good, that looks cool, that people use, that helps your practice.
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:32,798 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Mm-hmm.
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:44,978 [Rafael]
And, you know, that's my, my major thing. And also, in the future, if you decide also to
recommend me to other people, that's why also I give a-- I feel like I give a, a reasonable price,
'cause that, that's my main interest is00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:47,338 [Shai (Doctors Assistant)]
Yes, I know quite a few offices that needs a website.
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:47,368 [Rafael]
Yeah.
